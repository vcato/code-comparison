Ideas from Lee:

1. functions/methods that: return by reference, return by copy, return with move : for non member objects
2. getline vs cin 
3. constructor rule of 5  example 
4. overloaded functions vs template functions for same number of function parameters
5. using iterator++ vs for(auto x: list)
6. class/method vs struct/free functions
