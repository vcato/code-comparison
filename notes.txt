* Ideas
  * Side-by-side code examples.
  * Voting

* Guidelines
  * Avoid contrived examples
    * Use examples that are locally good.  It shouldn't be easy to make
      the code better while keeping the same approach.
    * Code should only differ in one fundamental way to make it easier
      to compare.
    * Code should be compilable.
      * Not sure how practical this will be.

* Code qualities
  * Readability
  * Performance
  * Efficiency
  * Maintainability
  * Error-proneness
  * Conciseness

* Comparisons
  * C strings vs std::string
  * Functional vs object-oriented
  * Sorting parallel arrays
  * Iterators using coroutines vs. manual

* Functionality
  * string split
